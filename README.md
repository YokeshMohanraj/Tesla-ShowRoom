#ðŸš— Tesla-ShowRoom 

ðŸ‘‰ I created a fictional showroom as an operating firm in which their sales and service processes are done through salesforce.  

ðŸ‘‰ I attempted to develop my own business circumstances and worked onÂ the solutionsÂ for those circumstances through the salesforce out of the box features.

#ðŸ“‘ CASE STUDY ABOUT THE BUSINESS:

ðŸ‘‰ The Tesla Showroom deals with second-hand cars. Showroom sales & service. They provide service warranty for those products brought from them.

ðŸ‘‰ The Cars are bought from individuals and as well as from Dealers.  

ðŸ‘‰ The Dealers are the Banks or NBFC who recover the vehicle from the people who havenâ€™t repayed their loan. Since their collateral is the vehicle. 


# ðŸ’¼ MAJOR BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS : 

ðŸ‘‰ The details of the vehicles and their source need to be tracked. The details of the person who sells the vehicle should also be stored in the org.  

ðŸ‘‰ The Process of Lead generating includes campaigns, web pages, Social Media Marketing and there will be direct leads who come and visit the showroom. 

ðŸ‘‰ The Leads should be contacted and be converted. If the Lead is converted the details of the lead should be moved to the next process of sales. 
If not converted, then it should be stayed in the lead itself. 

ðŸ‘‰ In the next process, the details of the customer should be stored, their contact information and how the sales process pipeline is defined. 

ðŸ‘‰ If the deal is closed the customer's SLA (Service level agreement) details should be updated. 
If not closed, the customer details should be kept up in the database with the reason for loss.  

ðŸ‘‰ After Purchasing the Product if the Customer has any issues or Problem.
They might visit the showroom with the vehicle, or They might raise a Service or Repair Request. The Request might be from website or Mail,
                                                                                         the requests recieved should be assigned properly to the service engineers. 
So that once they receive the request from the Service engineers might go to the customer place and pick the vehicle. 

 ðŸ‘‰ The cases should be assigned properly. Then the details of the problem or issue should be tracked and once it is completed, the customer should be notified. 
 
 ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰!!! Only some of the Major Requriements are mentioned Here, Other than this there are requirements which are mentioned inside the document. Worked on both with Configuration requirements and Programattic requirements.  !!!ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
