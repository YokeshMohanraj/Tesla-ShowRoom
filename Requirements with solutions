Requirement 1:  

The seller details and cars list objects are in Master Detail Relationship. 
If the seller object records contain child, then the deletion of the parent record should not be allowed. 

Code:  
          public class SellerDetailsHandler { 

              public static void PreventDeletion(List<Seller_Details__c>sellerlist) {
                  List<Car_List__c> carlist = [Select  Seller__c                                //list to get the sellers associated with cars record
                                               from Car_List__c         
                                               where Seller__c in: Trigger.oldMap.keyset()]; 	
                  Set<ID> Idset = new Set<ID>();               //New set to add the IDs. 

                  For(Car_List__c cars : carlist)              //Iterating the query list 
                  { 
                      Idset.add(cars.Seller__c);               //Add all the ID to the new set 
                  
                  } //End of for loop

                  For(Seller_Details__c sell:sellerlist)       //Iterating all the old Seller records 
                  { 
                    if(Idset.contains (sell.Id))               //Checking if the seller ID is equal to the ID in cars(Child)record 
                      { 
                    sell.adderror('The seller record is associated with cars record, so you are not allowed to delete');  
                      }                                        
                  } //End of the for loop
              } //End of the method
          }//End of the class
